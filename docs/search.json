    "text": "Lancaster AI (LAI) reading group is a weekly reading group focusing on topics related to AI, including but not limited to: diffusion models, information geometry, stochastic optimisation, geometric deep learning. It will be more tutorial-styled, instead of seminar-styled, tailored more towards people who wish to learn more about the recent developments of AI. This reading group is supported by the Prob_AI Hub.\nIn Term 1 24-25, we are learning diffusion models.\nFylde D31 and over Teams; Wednesday 2-3pm (mostly).\nEmail Rui or Andreas for any question related to the reading group.\n\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nLocation\nDate\nTime\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n\nA Brief Overview of Diffusion Models\nFylde D31 (and Teams)\n16 Oct 2024\n2.30pm - 3pm\nRui\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Famous Dog in Machine Learning"

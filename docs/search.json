    "text": "Lancaster AI (LAI) reading group is a weekly reading group focusing on topics related to AI, including but not limited to: diffusion models, information geometry, stochastic optimisation, geometric deep learning. It will be more tutorial-styled, instead of seminar-styled, tailored more towards people who wish to learn more about the recent developments of AI. This reading group is supported by the Prob_AI Hub.\nIn Term 1 24-25, we are learning diffusion models, following Step-by-Step Diffusion: An Elementary Tutorial.\n\n\n\nThe Most Famous Dog in Machine Learning"

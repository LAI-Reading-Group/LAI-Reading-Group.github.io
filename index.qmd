title: "LAI Reading Group"
---

Lancaster AI (**LAI**) reading group is a weekly reading group focusing on topics related to AI, including but not limited to: diffusion models, information geometry, stochastic optimisation, geometric deep learning. It will be more tutorial-styled, instead of seminar-styled, tailored more towards people who wish to learn more about the recent developments of AI. This reading group is supported by the [Prob_AI Hub](https://www.probai.uk/).

In Term 1, we are doing **optimisation for machine learning**.
In Term 2, we are doing **Bayesian deep learning**. If you are interested in giving a talk please contact [Andreas](mailto:a.makris@lancaster.ac.uk) or [Cass](mailto:c.durr@lancaster.ac.uk).

[**PSC LT and over Teams; Wednesday 2-3pm (mostly)**]{style="color:Blue"}.

See [here](./schedule.html) for the **full schedules**; [here](./past.html) for **past sessions**.

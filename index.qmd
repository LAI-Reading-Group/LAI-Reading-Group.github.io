---

Lancaster AI (**LAI**) reading group is a weekly reading group focusing on topics related to AI, including but not limited to: diffusion models, information geometry, stochastic optimisation, geometric deep learning. It will be more tutorial-styled, instead of seminar-styled, tailored more towards people who wish to learn more about the recent developments of AI. This reading group is supported by the [Prob_AI Hub](https://www.probai.uk/).

In Term 1 24-25, we are learning **diffusion models**, following [Step-by-Step Diffusion: An Elementary Tutorial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08929).

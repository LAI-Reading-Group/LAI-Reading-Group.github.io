title: "LAI Reading Group"
---

Lancaster AI (**LAI**) reading group is a weekly reading group focusing on topics related to AI, including but not limited to: diffusion models, information geometry, stochastic optimisation, geometric deep learning. It will be more tutorial-styled, instead of seminar-styled, tailored more towards people who wish to learn more about the recent developments of AI. This reading group is supported by the [Prob_AI Hub](https://www.probai.uk/).

In Term 1 24-25, we are learning **diffusion models**. 

**Fylde D31 and over Teams; Wednesday 2-3pm (mostly)**. 

See [here](./schedule.html) for the **full schedules**; [here](./past.html) for **past sessions**.

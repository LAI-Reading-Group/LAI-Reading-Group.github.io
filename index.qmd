title: "LAI Reading Group"
---

Lancaster AI (**LAI**) reading group is a weekly reading group focusing on topics related to AI, including but not limited to: diffusion models, information geometry, stochastic optimisation, geometric deep learning. It will be more tutorial-styled, instead of seminar-styled, tailored more towards people who wish to learn more about the recent developments of AI. This reading group is supported by the [Prob_AI Hub](https://www.probai.uk/).

In Term 3, we are doing **geometric deep learning**.

[**PSC Lab 2 and over Teams; Wednesday 2-3pm (mostly)**]{style="color:Blue"}.

See [here](./schedule.html) for the **full schedules**; [here](./past.html) for **past sessions**.
